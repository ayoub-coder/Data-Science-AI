This repo is for the ressearch project 
The main objective of this project is to analyze the dataset collected from the interaction of students with the Thonny environment. 
The team is specifically interested in understanding how students learn and interact with the programming environment while learning python programming.
By analyzing the traces left by students, the team hopes to identify key performance indicators (KPIs) that can differentiate programming behaviors 
among novice students. This will help to develop strategies and techniques that can help students learn more effectively and efficiently.
